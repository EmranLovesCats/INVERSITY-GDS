# INVERSITY-GDS
GDS repo for my html web
Iterations:
The first iteration had the ability to navigate the website. It had a homepage, accesibility page and a sign in page The majority of the buttons did not work
The accesibility page had information on what the buttons did but non of the buttons worked, The sign in page did not take any info but it did allow inputs into the text boxes. 
The website was not coded in HTML so its not even usable

The second iteration:
The overall website design was minimised but the majority of the limitations still existed with few exceptions. The sign in page gained a remember me tickbox, create account button
and a forgot password button, but none of these new features worked and the sign in page still doesnt take information.
The home page also gained a non functional popular services button. Website was 
still not coded in HTML so still not useable

Third iteration

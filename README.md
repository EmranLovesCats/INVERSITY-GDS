# INVERSITY-GDS
GDS repo for my html web
Iterations:
The first iteration had the ability to navigate the website. It had a homepage, accesibility page and a sign in page The majority of the buttons did not work
The accesibility page had information on what the buttons did but non of the buttons worked, The sign in page did not take any info but it did allow inputs into the text boxes. 
The website was not coded in HTML so its not even usable. Users said that it had limited functionality and the website design was unnappealing 

The second iteration:
The overall website design was minimised but the majority of the limitations still existed with few exceptions. The sign in page gained a remember me tickbox, create account button
and a forgot password button, but none of these new features worked and the sign in page still doesnt take information.
The home page also gained a non functional popular services button. Website was 
still not coded in HTML so still not useable. Users had said that the website again lacked functionality but the website design had improved and the opt

Third iteration
A lot more functionality had been added to the accesibility page(the main goal) such as buttons that change the sizeo of the text a colour blind mode and language options. the majority of the website design had been improved 
but I had lost the ability to cycle through pages with buttons. Users had said the functionality had been improved but there was still a lack of info on the website and the colour scheme was unappealing.
